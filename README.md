This app is a model of a car rental firm.
Project was created for the "Tworzenie aplikacji webowych z wykorzystaniem .NET Framework" course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science of the Warsaw University of Technology by following the instructions:
https://github.com/sulmar/pw-mini-dotnet-2024/blob/main/docs/project.md . Both Web App and API use Microsoft Azure Platform (keys were changed for data protection) - SQL Database Server, Blob Storage, App Service. They were created with MVC design pattern.
Web App allows customers to login and register (Entity Framework and Google API keys - here altered for security reasons), moreover users can search for offers, rent cars and return them. 
API is responsible for all the operation on the real cars, rentals and returns data. Web App is compatible with different APIs (one given in this repo and the other shared by other team).
